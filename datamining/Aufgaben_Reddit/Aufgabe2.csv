a3oicn,2018-12-06 14:44:57,efu6ba6,"There is a MASSIVE flaw in this suggestion. CTF's are amazing to put what you have learned to the test... but CTF's are not going to teach you core fundamentals. Every hacker should aspire to know not only the big picture but all the individual pieces that make up the puzzle.
No CTF is going to help you memorize the 4 layers of the TCP/IP stack and the 7 layers of the OSI model. Not that knowing those two things are essential but a basic understanding of Networking (at least) ABSOLUTELY is.
You could spend the next year playing with CTF's everyday and only learn a quarter of what you could learn in a single CISCO networking course. I just feel that there is no substitution for really sitting down and studying the craft. Listen to a Defcon talk while you take a free Python class on www.CodeAcademy.com, spend 30 minutes a day on a free class with www.Cybrary.com and another 30 minutes reading one of Kevin Mitnick's book to help immerse yourself into the world and mindset of a hacker. 
I can only speak for myself but I had to break some bad, lazy habits. CyberSecurity saved my life and made me a better person. I feel like a part of that was making myself sit down and crack open a book for at least an hour a day, it helped create discipline. I got a hold of ""The Basics of Hacking and Penetration Testing - by Pat Engebretson on Syngress Press."" By the time I finished it, I COULD NOT WAIT to restart it because I was getting apparent, noticable results.
CTF's are totally kickass, I endorse them fully (who the hell wouldn't?!) but if learning is your goal I feel there's faster ways to make gains. When it comes to practice though, there's nothing on earth better than a CTF.

a3oicn,2018-12-06 14:44:57,hhajg6a,"I’m really interested in becoming an ethical hacker. I’m getting a late start at the age of 30 and I am not very familiar with any of it, but I am pretty good with electronics and software. Im gonna humble brag a little but I think I have a good mind for it. I’m a critical thinker/can think outside the box and I’m a good problem solver maybe even a problem solving addict lol. The idea of doing it for a living isn’t just a dream it’s something I am willing to give my all. Thank you for this information. Does anyone have any recommendations for a starter machine and OS that would be best as I learn and progress?",10,potluckparadox,2021-10-19 22:45:34
a3oicn,2018-12-06 14:44:57,jyy7obg,"another fact to add would be\~  you need to be committed towards it and have patience. You won't become a hacker over night. You will have to read lots of books related to hacking. To get started you need to have the following requirements.

 Programming Languages:

Learn C, Assembly, C++ for system hacking.

Learn any object oriented programming - C++ or Java or C# whichever you are comfortable with

Learn PHP, Python etc for website related hacking

Master SQL in order to perform SQL Injection on website and retrieving information or gaining unauthorized access to the database

2. Computer Networks

Its a heart of hacking. First learn basics of network. Learn TCP/IP suite and learn how things actually work on the network

3. Linux

Get used to linux environment. In order to start with linux go for Ubuntu since its debian based user friendly OS. Learn commands and get used to commands to ease your work while working on Kali Linux(Linux distro for penetration Testers)

\-----

After all that you should get started with the practicals. To get started with practicals you should have the following things.

1. Virtual Box or VMWare Workstation:

Used to create virtual environment for practicing hacking and perform penetration testing. Install kali linux, one or more windows OSes and metasploitable linux(intentionally vulnerable linux) in your Virtual box or VMWare workstation.

You can also install Kali linux on your hard disk and create virtual windows OSes and linux. Choose whichever you are comfortable with.

2. Kali Linux:

Its a debian based linux distro meant for penetration testers. There are n number of tools already built in to distro viz Nmap, Wireshark, Burpsuite, OWASP ZAP, Metasploit to name a few. Learn how to use the tools by either google searching, going through hack related sites and youtube videos. Now use Kali linux to perform penetration testing on windows or metasploitable linux.

It probably goes without saying that to become a hacker you need some basic computer skills. These skills go beyond the ability to create a Word document or cruise the Internet. You need to be able to use the command line in Windows, edit the registry, and set up your networking parameters.Networking SkillsYou need to understand the basics of networking, such as the following.DHCPSubnettingIPv4IPv6DNSRouters and switches VLANsOSI modelMAC addressing ARPAs hackers are often exploiting these technologies, the better you understand how they work, the more successful you will beLinux SkillsIt is extremely critical to develop Linux skills to become a hacker. Nearly all the tools a hacker uses is developed for Linux and Linux gives us capabilities that we don't have using Windows .Security Concepts & Technologies A good hacker understands security concepts and technologies. The only way to overcome the roadblocks established by the security admins is to be familiar with them. The hacker must understand such things as PKI (public key infrastructure), SSL (secure sockets layer), IDS (intrusion detection system), firewalls, etc .Wireless Technologies  In order to be able to hack wireless, you must first understand how it works. Things like the encryption algorithms (WEP, WPA, WPA2), the four-way handshake, and WPS. In addition, understanding such as things as the protocol for connection and authentication and the legal constraints on wireless technologies. Scripting Without scripting skills, the hacker will be relegated to using other hackers' tools. This limits your effectiveness. Every day a new tool is in existence loses effectiveness as security admins come up with defenses. To develop your own unique tools, you will need to become proficient at least in one of the scripting languages including the BASH shell. These should include one of Perl, Python, or Ruby. Database Skills If you want to be able to proficiently hack databases, you will need to understand databases and how they work. This includes the SQL language .Web Applications Web applications are probably the most fertile ground for hackers in recent years. The more you understand about how web applications work and the databases behind them, the more successful you will be.  In addition, you will likely need to build your own website for phishing and other nefarious purposes .Forensics  To become good hacker, you must not be caught! You can't become a pro hacker sitting in a prison cell for 5 years. The more you know about digital forensics, the better you can become at avoiding and evading detection .The beginner hacker must understand TCP/IP basics, but to rise to the intermediate level, you must understand in intimate details the TCP/IP protocol stack and fields. These include how each of the fields (flags, window, df, tos, seq, ack, etc.) in both the TCP and IP packet can be manipulated and used against the victim system to enable MitM attacks, among other things.  Reverse Engineering Reverse engineering enables you to open a piece of malware and re-build it with additional features and capabilities. Just like in software engineering, no one builds a new application from scratch. Nearly every new exploit or malware uses components from other existing malware. Think Creatively There is ALWAYS a way to hack a system and many ways to accomplish it. A good hacker can think creatively of multiple approaches to the same hack.  Problem-Solving Skills A hacker is always coming up against seemingly unsolvable problems. This requires that the hacker be accustomed to thinking analytically and solving problems. This often demands that the hacker diagnose accurately what is wrong and then break the problem down into separate components. This is one of those abilities that comes with many hours of practice. Persistence A hacker must be persistent. If you fail at first, try again. If that fails, come up with a new approach and try again. It is only with a persistence that you will be able to hack the most secured systems.

a3oicn,2018-12-06 14:44:57,jyy618i,"Rule 101. Knowledge should be free this is what hackers believe. Now i am not saying that you shouldn't buy a course I am just saying many Hackers are self-taught ,In order to become a good hacker, ethical or no, you need to know programming, operating systems and networking. Start with one of those three depending on what you want to hack. Let’s say for example you want to hack websites. The first thing you need to do is learn to code websites if yoy want to be any good. Don’t even think about hacking yet. Start with a full-stack PHP framework. Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. Learn about the OSI model, especially the application layer protocols too. But build websites with client-server applications or network-based applications. Do that for six months at least and then (and only then) will you be able to be able to hack websites. Otherwise you won’t get very far. If you don’t like learning to code for fun and if you don’t like learning how stuff works, you cannot ever be any kind of hacker. In this case purchase a Udemy course on full-stack web development and start learning.

Another example is if you want to hack wireless networks, VoIP, wireless devices, Bluetooth, etc. Research wireless networking. Look up on YouTube computer networking and see if you like what you are learning about them maybe buy books on computer networking which exist. Maybe you could buy The TCP/IP Guide or maybe a book on CISCO networking. Maybe get a Udemy course on Network+. Work on it for a long time but learn how networks work, especially networking protocols but learn everything you can about how they work not just protocols. Once you get basic computer networking skill only then you will be able to learn to attack 802.11, Ethernet, Bluetooth, etc. networks. If you want to exploit operating systems then you need to learn how operating systems work. You can get manuals on just about any operating system and yes OS X and MacOS are just as easy to hack as Windows or Linux and Apple knows it and Apple even has a bug bounty program (which I will talk about soon for you). Once you know how operating systems work and have sufficient experience working with them, only then will you be able to learn to exploit them. After you do that, and only after you do that, go to Udemy hacking courses, get hacking books, go for online tutorials on hacking etc.  To be extremely good it’s always ideal to have a specialty, but still be well-rounded. What I mean is there’s no way to know everything about everything. You need to have an area of hacking you like most. Different areas include: Web hacking - exploiting flaws in web application code to get usernames and passwords, give a thousand upvotes on a website when you are only are allowed to give one, defacing websites, and a whole lot more  Mobile app hacking exploiting flaws in mobile application code; similar to web hacking but where you plug your smartphone into your computer and actually attack the applications on your phone from the computer, like hacking Snapchat or WhatsApp messages for example Wireless hacking - finding a way to break into a car and control via Bluetooth as opposed to hot wiring, hacking a router for a WiFi password maybe even hacking an iPhone or desktop that is on the same network as you or performing a man-in-the-middle attack to get the web history of someone on the same network as you Internet of Things hacking - combo of wireless hacking and hardware hacking that allows you to hack a smart fridge, thermostat, Bluetooth connection of a car, someone’s smartwatch, and loads of other devices Reverse engineering - breaking software apart to see the assembly level code, not the original source code, then exploiting that assembly code in order to get something to happen that the original programmer didn’t intend to happen; this one is useful combined with web hacking, mobile app hacking, or even operating system and server exploitation Operating system and server exploitation involves exploiting flaws in the operating system of either a normal client computer or even a server in order to get access to that person’s files, documents, etc. stored on their hard drive Hardware hacking - taking hardware apart and modifying it, putting it back together a different way, and reusing it for something it wasn’t intended to do; can be combined with wireless hacking to help gain access to companies’ networks or even their private devices  Hacking using a programming language to make your own tools - this one you can start building your own tools when gain some skill but is more to help you in the areas of hacking you study There are other areas of having too but those are some of the more common ones. Once you know how stuff works, then get Kali Linux or whatever Linux OS you want and learn. But have one area of interest. Be especially well practiced in one or two areas, but know the basics of several .But keep repeating the process of learning how stuff works, then learning to hack that stuff. When you are good at several but have two or three chosen areas you are especially good at, then you can get a job as an ethical hacker and be good at it.  

The quintessential areas of hacking are: WiFi hacking, network hacking, web hacking, reverse engineering, server exploitation, exploit development, and programming (most important one), social engineering, etc, Some additional areas you can learn are mobile application hacking, iOS hacking, Android OS hacking, Open source intelligence, different sub areas of reverse engineering (browser hacking, operating system reverse engineering, video game hacking, etc), database hacking (because you can go further than just what’s required for web hacking in terms of being an expert at database hacking, advanced VoIP hacking, hardware hacking, CISCO device hacking, Juniper device hacking, cryptography, and many many more….

Its like knowing how to shoot bullets and how the guns work but not possesing guns or not having gun will likely get you killed in combat. (Bad example but you get the point right?) IMHO the true approach should be dealing with both, if possible simultaneously. Infact I think that liveoverflow channel owner's most videos discuss tools along with methodology rather than seggregating them.

So, to conclude: A mix method of both must be used, wherein people learn to use tools,kali and stuffs along with learning how they work on core level and should be approached in a rather gradual way.",2,Sugoypotato,2019-06-02 15:29:24

I tried Kali since it's what everyone talks about, however after a few months I still feel like I've learned nothing, I really don't know what it is I'm missing lol.

I'll get into CTFs (of which I'm absolutely petrified btw lol), and hopefully I'll be on my way to a better future.

a3oicn,2018-12-06 14:44:57,k3p5qwx,"As a tester by trade, I have wanted to learn ethical hacking, but I am also someone who can easily go off on a tangent, and every time I decide to sit down and stqrt learning about hacking, I seem to find myself faced with a million links, tools, techniques and so on.

Can anyone offer me just **one** place to start? For someone who knows nothing at all about hacking?

&#x200B;

Or one technique to learn first off, ie a (relatively) simple exploit and something I can do to prove it worked without having to download loads of tools (ie one tool and now to use it).

&#x200B;

along with a gazillion options and tools, most info assumes I already have preexisting knowledge I dont, and then I am looking at a tool and having to go off and find other info on how to install the tool the commands it has, what environment it runs in, etc etc, and there I go off on another tangent

&#x200B;

can anyone recommend any online resources for just one type of hack, which take you through from beginning to end?  I only have a windows laptop atm, but if a linux one is needed I can set up a dual boot or vm etc (and if so, do i need a specific linux distro?)

&#x200B;

its great to have options, but when you ae starting out and prone to being easily distracted, a post with 10 -20 links just leaves me going ""oooh that's cool, oooh thats cool too, ooh i want that its shiny and fun, hang on, no i want to do that one first!"" etc etc

&#x200B;

hoping someone out there will just say ""go to this one url, download and install this one tool and use this one video/instructional url"".

&#x200B;

id just like to try just one thing and get it to work, before being overwhelmed with lots more options.

its not the coding side I am struggling with, its the setup and all the tools on offer etc etc. 

&#x200B;

id like to try something simple (but there is so much info and ""noise"" out there I am not even sure what a simple hack would be?)",2,Kimmyh51,2023-10-06 10:33:38

All I see is posts about CTF it seems to me that all this CTF stuff is some dumb game that's being played and not actually doing anything productive.   I want to learn the RAT and  malicious links that's actually accomplishing something.   You know how many husbands or wives could use such help on knowing the truth about their partner how many lives that could save and make better but no one is offering to help those people so many of them would be so much better off but these so called hackers that ask for money or pay 1st are just  scamming people.  I promise you that if someone would actually prove their work before payment you would control the entire hacking world.   You would be the elite.  But no one does that and that just kinda makes me believe that no one can actually do it. They just scamming people and only creating more pain more problems more hurt for so many people.,0,gotME77,2023-08-08 02:22:58

I am extremely new and lacking any type of knowledge in this area, however, my interest has been peaked! You see over 8 weeks ago my husband decided to text me that he wants a divorce but because he is cheating and told others that I WAS INDEED cheating ( never in a million would I destroy my children’s life this way!) he had his high tech brothers, they built a company Microsoft bought! 
So, he and they terrorised my life. My phones, laptop, desktop, my mothers phone and her iPad were all attacked AND he is in our WiFi at home apparently and watching every keystroke I’m making at the moment. I can’t afford to replace this iPhone 11pm max and don’t know how to get out whatever has been put into it… malware, from what I’ve read. No idea. My husband is just bored with me, it’s been 24 years of the same hot, loving , willing and wonderful wife and mother, he’s told me how I’ve aged and im looking really saggy. Lol, im 55! Anyway, I need help. Take pity on me someone please. This is so unfair. He watches my every move…

However if you are interested in remote access and penetrating systems, such as servers, remote machines, etc I personally think reverse engineering software will give you a hard time and might have little success.

Usually servers have a few ports open. Most of the times its stuff like nginx, apache, mysql, etc. You will have a hard time exploiting those battle tested software on your own. You could be more successful just searching for the publicly available exploits for those services and executing them, especially if they are some older versions. Now if there are some lesser known software running behind an open port, yeah reverse engineering and building your own exploit could help, but I feel that is a rather rare scenario.

Depending on your end goal, social engineering, web hacking (xss, csrf, file upload vulnerabilities, etc) and brute forcing could be much more effective and require far less skill to penetrate system.",1,Odd_Ad3953,2023-05-09 18:01:47

All I know is that for some odd reason, cellular companies from different countries all have tunnels connected to my devices.

Lot more but yeah, that’s all. I don’t think I can even appreciate the act of playing CTF. Guess who was turned in to a target for that very exact thing… I even found the flag but I was literally battling them as a clueless end-user. I’ve blued out a few times, the screen I mean, as in screen of death.

Well now me and my family are all hacked and being harassed and there’s nothing we can do.

Just being cryptojacked on all of our devices which I believe whoever is doing it is mining Ethereum.

I don’t think most would understand the CTF that I’ve been put through… Just wanna say thanks to the “hackers” for making sure lives are ruined.

I’ll just keep doing me regardless. I will do my very best to be all I can be in our next life and I’m going to show those p.p.o.s what a true hacker is.

I truly hope my wish comes true and the very kingdom that is Malbern remains Eternal. Hell, you thought hacking and torturing innocent people was fun… Just wait, I hope all the bad ones that read this change your ways cause it is not going to be pretty for any of you. Would be funny, don’t you think?

Imagine when we pass on, that we would go to rest… Well, now… Instead of that, it may very well be changing to provide for the lovely beings that deserve the world to be beautiful.

That would have to be considered a rude awakening for anybody who’s been causing harm to anything else..

Just warning y’all… Stay true to the true, all the way through cause Time ain’t got Time for pathetic pieces of shit. I’d say regardless, better start working on your contributions to the wellbeing of others, especially the ones you hurt/are hurting.",1,TrailingCircles,2023-06-18 03:17:34

I know WHY im being hacked but I was just wondering if someone out there on this beautiful site might be able to help me figure out A) HOW im being hacked and B) What I can do to protect myself. I can give you some info about my situation. Basically Im being hacked because I visit a sports stream site to watch and bet on sports. I have a pretty good understanding how the betting market works and I try use it to make money. Ive been talking a lot of shit on chat and now i realize that the mods in chat will hack you to try to stop you from spreading information about how betting works. The extent of the hacking is that they hacked into my phone and my instagram and now they can see everything I do on there which I would have rather have been private but now its not. Also they seem to be able to know everything I do on the internet almost as if they can see my screen. Please help! What should I do???",1,SteakNo6164,2023-12-02 04:31:22

a3oicn,2018-12-06 14:44:57,eb92maj,"A great question. Once you have gained enough knowledge to be able to find modern-day exploits, you may go out on the internet and look for active vulnerabilities. By finding one, and by disclosing it responsibly, you are essentially closing off an entryway to destruction. If the vulnerability is serious enough you may submit and gain a CVE (which stands for common vulnerabilities and exposures [https://cve.mitre.org/](https://cve.mitre.org/)) under your name, which is a rather grand achievement in itself. This is what one would call 'gray hat hacking'.

&#x200B;

However, this is not the only option. The knowledge you gain from just competing and learning about CTFs may be used in building solid network structures for companies, organisations, and governments. A more far-fetched idea would be thinking about the future of space exploration. Imagine being granted the job of engineering a space rocket's internet.

You may also create open-source security packages to patch systems and networks. You may also completely deviate away from security to use your knowledge in software engineering and entrepreneurship, to deploy your own business from the technical knowledge you've learned.

The number of possibilities is endless, as CTF is only a gateway into the realm of computing & programming. So essentially just dig deep and explore - your knowledge will take you on it's own journey.",28,SlickLibro,2018-12-06 23:34:10

Too many people that have googled their way through the invite code and subsequently through HTB. Their CTF style challenges are excellent, but they are somewhat hidden away under an unremarkable tab. The main reason it didn’t quite make the cut is that it isn’t exactly the best place to start learning (hence the presence of an invite code). 

The other sites however, somewhat force you to learn essential fundamentals before you would even have a chance at attempting a respectable challenge, making you understand the full picture instead of providing a quick shortcut.

First things first, look into certifications, even if you have no plans on getting any. Certs outline and test your knowledge of a given subject and show you are proficient in it. Since you mentioned networking basics, I suggest looking into network + from comptia, it goes over the basics. From there, research other certs and things of interest. I don't have it with me, but if you look up comptia cert road map on Google, you'll find a list of paths you can follow and what certs to get.  Hopefully this will help you get started.

a3oicn,2018-12-06 14:44:57,ebeeg42,"I do understand what you are saying here, but I have to disagree with you on the point of not 'knowing the fundamentals'. CTF naturally forces you to learn the fundamentals in a very intense manner. There is no way you can progress through a CTF without understanding the 'big picture', and it most definitely does not teach you how to do very specific things in very specific situations.

&#x200B;

Take for example a simple case of any binary exploitation challenge - it requires you to disassemble the program in order to analyse the machine code - so that you can map out each and every individual function. You then use what you see to build a mental image of what you're dealing with, and then finally at that point do you consider your options for exploitation. In a matter of a few steps we've already covered learning the use unix commands, how a program is assembled in machine code, how to read the machine code itself, how the machine code interacts with the system's memory, and how to reverse-engineer such machine code into it's respective high-level language functions. Understand that CTF requires you to know the fundamentals/'big picture' as fluently as possible before you could even progress through the simplest of challenges.

&#x200B;

This example only covers one case, as CTF also expands out into forensics (stenography, data, & analysing network packets), web exploitation (which forces you to learn everything from js, html, php, common libraries, API's, to full stack web development), miscellaneous (which involves crucial scripting skills) and cryptography (for mathematics & encryption). In each and every single case you must understand fully what you are dealing with, or else you would be left lost with no direction.

&#x200B;

Through this knowledge alone one would eventually start seeing the intricacies of technology around us, and thus begin to see how they can apply their knowledge for use in real-world situations. The point of CTF may be directed towards exploitation, but there is any underlying set of fundamentals you must learn & apply if you want any chance of success - and this learned knowledge alone should be more than enough to use in real world scenarios.",92,SlickLibro,2018-12-09 02:27:14

Check out the humble bundle that was posted somewhere. There’s some really good stuff in there, but just googling basic ports, the seven layers, and networking fundamentals will get you on the right track. 

If you find yourself asking “what does that do” or researching more than you’re learning - then you’re heading in the right direction.

a3oicn,2018-12-06 14:44:57,egxib3j,"I myself was not a fan of the CTF approach and did the long term studying/theory approach.

I had a security class with who at the time seemed like the devil himself who liked  CTFs and made use do them for labwork; it's the ""throw em in the water drown or swim"" situation for learning hacking. It was a sentiment that teacher had and  boy did I drown a lot. 

I admire it for being the ""quick and dirty"" way to force you to learn a lot in a short amount of time, but I did not retain nearly as much as I would have if I had a better understanding of certain computer fundamentals related to OS features and Networking (TCP/IP). The CTFs forced me to know enough to pass the challenge, I wasn't learning how to think or how to do research as if I was really building an attack vector or trying to come up with an exploit akin to what security researchers or some pen testers might do while under contract with a scope of devices that may be limited or obscure. Most of what I learned in his class I had to revisit to retain it despite the harsh introduction to those concepts CTFs provide.

I respect OP's post whole-hardheartedly considering I have not seen a post assembled so well as he did it, but there's a certain ""discipline"" i think you find in having to comb through the boring stuff including the fundamentals that will make CTFs easier and more exciting when the person doing it understands what they're doing. As others said, CTFs vary so much; if someone does not diversify themselves in their CTFs they would fall into a niche or one type of hacking. Its not necessarily bad, but I feel like it limits your prospects.

 Sometimes the boring theory over a period of time builds a bank of knowledge where you can know where to look for certain things despite the limited basic knowledge. Like that scary professor used to tell me:

""information security is a mile wide and an inch deep""

 you have to know a little bit of everything to *start,* not necessarily have the outcome ready and at hand. That does come with the practice of multiple CTFs, but my concern is someone who finds they are good at say, website pen-testing based CTFs, might only continue this because they find the gratification in solving the challenges,and being right all the time, especially for new and younger individuals, not everyone likes to hack because they like computers or are nerds like you say, movies and the media made people like us for better or worse, the ""hip and cool"" guys to be right now.  They would lack that ""shallow ocean"" of starting material to even consider trying their hand at something else like memory analysis or reverse engineering. I think that would start to bite you in the butt if they start to do this (hacking and penetration testing) professionally. 

&#x200B;

Take someone like Samy Kamkar for instance: Starts off as a Programming prodigy, makes his own company and inadvertently creates a XSS javascript worm and gives him notoriety.  Starts off with just web based stuff. Regardless if you like the guy or not, he's a critical thinker; since then he's had a variety of projects and attacks with a whole breath of varied technologies from NFC to PHP backends or RFID. His most recent stuff involved applied and time tested network attacks like MITM to smart/connected cars. 

What no one likes to acknowledge (or think about I should say) is the man like many other hackers and researchers comb over books and documentation and have to read and do ""boring"" research which might mean not being in front of a computer all the time. Hardware hacking is like a complete 360 from what he started off with, and certain exploits such as a MITM on a car comes from understanding of fundamentals and implementing it creatively. You wouldn't piece together different things like he would unless you understood the basics very well and was creative and experimented. The guy isn't a mastermind by any stretch, but he's one of those researchers that takes the wide limited knowledge approach and then forms a scope for further investigation and research. A CTF has an answer to it that is known to someone else, it may not be the best way to encourage creative thinking for the real application of hacking skills.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Capture the Flags could form a gratification loop in new inexperienced hackers as compared to forcing newbies to learn a little bit about everything including the fundamentals, as the gratification/feedback loop they enter keeps them focused on CTFs they are ""good"" at and limits their prospects in other areas of hacking they may have not considered because they don't do research on CTF topics they are not good at. This limits the ability to think of creative solutions (like those needed for real world exploit development/hacking).

a3oicn,2018-12-06 14:44:57,ebgyib6,"I suppose it depends on how you look at it.

One one hand, CTFs do work as you've explained here, however because CTFs have a myriad of categories and challenges, you really end up putting yourself in specific situations for each challenge and then moving onto a completely separate situation and possibly forgetting the previous challenge.

Working your way up through the fundamentals and then focusing on one aspect of InfoSec (binex, netsec, websec, etc) for a long time until you truly understand it, then moving onto another category allows you to build your understanding without drinking from the firehose of security by taking multiple categories of challenges at one time.

Of course, CTFs/wargames are a great supplement for this type of learning. For example, if you are working on reverse engineering, [smashthestack.](https://smashthestack.io)org would be great to supplement readings of that type of subject to get practical experience.

Of course, this is just my opinion from my experience in the field. In obtaining the OSCP/OSCE and real-world pentesting, I've found that building the fundamentals separately helps much more when turning them into security related concepts.",17,loyalsif,2018-12-10 02:04:20

a3oicn,2018-12-06 14:44:57,eejpy3y,"I see what you're trying to say here but I think that /u/Nau71lus raises a fair point.

You're not wrong when you say that it's impossible to progress through a CTF without understanding the 'big picture', but then you're creating individuals who focus on one area in an almost zombie-like way until they move through to the next challenge. When I'm partaking in a CTF and I get the gist or understand that a challenge has to do with steg, cryptography, or even just exploiting the function of a web app  - I work in those areas until I accomplish the task and then move on. Yes, I learn a lot in the progress but I'm looking for something to accomplish the task at hand rather than learning the fundamentals as to how embedding data in an image works, or when the exploit was found, how it was leveraged and then reading or watching a PoC. 

I suppose it really narrows down to who you are. He wasn't saying that this approach wouldn't work for everyone, but this approach might teach individuals bad habits, or the wrong things. You don't have to learn the fundamentals of an application to succeed in a CTF. I think you can look at those who've worked on Hack the Box machines and approach something like the OSCP which is less CTF-like and struggle since they don't understand some of the fundamentals. For example, it's far less likely you're going to face a steg challenge in the real world when attacking a machine or network. There are some fundamentals in CTF machines like using nmap or BurpSuite that are great for beginners to work with and understand, but using these tools on DVWA or Metasploitable would be far more beneficial for them as they could learn how to leverage, and then fix the vulnerability. 

I do believe that CTFs may give beginners a sense of direction, but I think that if they only focus on the CTF approach they will miss many of the fundamentals that are needed to excel in this area. There are some scenarios where CTFs are incredible learning opportunities, but I've played and owned many machines where I understood all of the fundamentals and was simply just mislead because CTFs are less real world like and more of a ""game"" or ""challenge"". HTB is a great example in the challenge section where no source code is provided and you're almost expected to guess the vulnerability rather than use the data (like in a real world scenario) to find out which attack vector to exploit.",3,scriptalert1script,2019-01-20 17:20:01

a3oicn,2018-12-06 14:44:57,i5asib5,"Hello. This was an extremely insightful post and I’m very grateful this is here. I’m currently going through frustration when it comes to cyber security. I don’t currently have any friends or family in the field, so as far as a reliable person I can go to for guidance is non existent at the moment. I have been attempting to self study for a while now and I enrolled in a lot of different online classes from Udemy that covers cyber security topics. The issue is it’s mostly geared towards Kali and it’s a tool based approach.

“It doesn’t matter how it works, what’s important is that it does work.”

This is how the classes feel to me and it’s irritating. For example, going through a section on metasploit, there is no detailed information as to why or how exploits work. It’s just that it does work, but if it doesn’t, oh well keep looking for one that does. This type of teaching leaves me feeling unfulfilled and that I didn’t learn anything. Almost like a restricted “one way path” type of approach. There is no out of the box thinking in these courses.

I would really like to start exploring the fundamentals, but I have no idea where to start. The cyber security landscape can feel overwhelming to me at times. I have been considering my A+, Network+ and Security+. I’m not sure if this is a good place to start when it comes to the “boring” fundamentals, or if there are much better resources out there.

a3oicn,2018-12-06 14:44:57,ecbu88k,"My problem with CTF as a method of ""learning to hack"" is that all of the steps you take are in service of finding a flag, and the timing aspect makes it less likely that what you are doing is going to end up in your long-term memory. For some individuals, like me, it can be kind of a poor substitute for learning. I definitely need to take some time to really learn the basics and get comfortable with linux and networking before I go back to attempting CTFs. For me, sitting down with books and tutorial videos is a good method, at least for where I am at right now. So I definitely agree with you in that regard. ",8,Necromancy4dummies,2018-12-22 16:53:02

I was thinking at least networking would be one to study a lot of. I did a lot of self-learning on topics and always felt drawn to liveoverflow and Eli the computer guy, both on YouTube. If I came across a topic in a CTF/war game, I would make a note of it and study it later, trying to figure out how it worked.  

If you truly know how something works, you’ll be better at picking it apart and exploiting vulnerabilities I think. You can analyze it and come up with creative ways to bypass the security control. ",6,masterninja01,2019-01-20 21:41:34

But then after a while you learn Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory and use the Peano Axioms to derive what arithmetic really IS, and then you can use a calculator as a shortcut because you fully understand what's going on ""under the hood"". So there's sort of two types of people using calculators, those doing it to ""cheat"" and those doing it as a shortcut for the otherwise tedious work of a greater problem.

a3oicn,2018-12-06 14:44:57,ej7mpky,"The short answer would be to start reading and install a Linux distro. 

I personally do not recommend Kali linux, especially if you are installing it to hardware, BUT there's a great no starch press book called "" Linux basics for hackers. It forces you to get involved in automating your system, learning terminal commands and writing some of your own tools and scripts. My only gripe is the author uses Kali Linux. It's not typical of a Linux distro but it is THE pen testing distro. He installs it in virtual box. The book is very good for learning Linux in general as well. I would use that and skip most other books. Kali Linux revealed by the company who maintains Kali also is good. 

I would also recommend getting a tcp/ip reference book. Might be pricey but I prefer print copies. Anything with computers needs  reference material, especially when learning. It's impossible to memorize everything but as your hand gets better at hacking you will remember the most common things. 

Another book I would recommend is called ""attacking network protocols"" by James forshaw. If you read this, then compare what you're confused with against a tcp/ip reference book, you will understand a lot more about what is going on. 

This is why I was against using Kali, some people get tempted to use the tools right away but don't understand how it works.

Actually can i join and hangout with you guys? Lol I dont know if i can really get too involved like going the ctf path with stuff going on, but i feel like i may can learn more than surface level than i do to protect myself and those around me",2,kk_ahiru,2024-02-22 22:39:03
